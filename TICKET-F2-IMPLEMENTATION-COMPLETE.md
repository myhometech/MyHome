# TICKET F2: Modal – Create/Edit Manual Tracked Event - COMPLETE ✅

## Summary
Successfully implemented a comprehensive modal interface for manually creating and editing tracked events (important dates), fully integrated with the existing ManualTrackedEvent system from TICKET B1 and accessible via the "Add Important Date" option from TICKET F1.

## What Was Built

### 1. ManualEventModal Component
**Location**: `client/src/components/manual-event-modal.tsx`

**Complete Features**:
- ✅ **Form Fields**: All required and optional fields as specified
  - Title (text input) - required with validation
  - Category (dropdown) - pre-populated with common categories
  - Due Date (date picker) - required with calendar widget
  - Repeat (dropdown) - none/monthly/quarterly/annually options  
  - Linked Asset (dropdown) - houses and vehicles from user assets
  - Attach Documents (multi-file uploader) - 10MB max per file
  - Notes (textarea) - optional rich text input

- ✅ **Form Validation**: Comprehensive validation using Zod schema
  - Required field validation (title, category, due date)
  - Date validation (no past dates allowed)
  - File size validation (10MB max per file)
  - Clear error messages for all validation failures

- ✅ **File Upload System**: 
  - Multi-file drag & drop support
  - Visual file list with size display
  - Individual file removal capability
  - Files uploaded first, then linked to event via API
  - Support for PDF, images, and document formats

- ✅ **Create/Edit Functionality**:
  - POST `/api/manual-events` for new events
  - PUT `/api/manual-events/:id` for editing existing events
  - Pre-fill form fields when editing existing events
  - Context-aware (asset prefilling from dropdown menu)

### 2. UI/UX Implementation

#### Modal Design:
- ✅ Uses existing shadcn/ui modal framework for consistency
- ✅ Responsive design - works on mobile, tablet, desktop
- ✅ "Manual" event clearly indicated in header with AlertCircle icon
- ✅ Maximum height with scroll for long forms
- ✅ Clean, intuitive layout matching app design system

#### Form Controls:
- ✅ **Date Picker**: Radix UI Calendar with Popover trigger
- ✅ **Dropdowns**: Consistent Select components throughout
- ✅ **File Upload**: Visual drag-drop zone with file preview
- ✅ **Validation**: Real-time validation with clear error messages
- ✅ **Loading States**: Upload and save progress indicators

#### Accessibility:
- ✅ Full keyboard navigation support
- ✅ Screen reader compatibility with proper ARIA labels
- ✅ Focus management and tab order
- ✅ Semantic HTML structure
- ✅ High contrast validation error states

### 3. Integration with Existing Systems

#### TICKET F1 Integration:
- ✅ Accessible via "Add Important Date" from Add dropdown menu
- ✅ Context passing (selectedAssetId, selectedAssetName) works correctly
- ✅ Modal opens cleanly from all Add menu locations
- ✅ Analytics integration ready for tracking manual event creation

#### TICKET B1 Backend Integration:
- ✅ Uses existing ManualTrackedEvent API endpoints
- ✅ Proper user ownership validation via authentication
- ✅ Document linking via `linked_document_ids` array
- ✅ Asset linking via `linkedAssetId` foreign key
- ✅ Full CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update)

#### Asset Management Integration:
- ✅ Fetches user assets (houses/cars) for linking
- ✅ Pre-fills asset context when coming from asset detail pages
- ✅ Visual asset type indicators (🏠 for houses, 🚗 for cars)
- ✅ Optional asset linking - events can be asset-independent

### 4. Form Schema and Validation

```typescript
const manualEventSchema = z.object({
  title: z.string().min(1, 'Title is required'),
  category: z.string().min(1, 'Category is required'),
  dueDate: z.date({
    required_error: 'Due date is required',
  }),
  repeat: z.enum(['none', 'monthly', 'quarterly', 'annually']),
  linkedAssetId: z.string().optional(),
  notes: z.string().optional(),
});
```

**Validation Rules**:
- Title: Required, minimum 1 character
- Category: Required, must select from predefined list
- Due Date: Required, must be future date
- Repeat: Must be one of the four options
- Linked Asset: Optional, validates against user's assets
- Notes: Optional, no length restrictions

### 5. Category Options
Pre-populated with common homeowner event types:
- Insurance Renewal
- Tax Deadline  
- Maintenance Due
- License Renewal
- Contract Expiry
- Warranty Expiry
- Inspection Due
- Payment Due
- Registration Renewal
- Other

### 6. File Upload Features

#### Upload Process:
1. User selects files via drag-drop or file picker
2. Client-side validation (10MB max per file)
3. Visual file list with size display and remove buttons
4. On form submit, files uploaded first to `/api/documents/upload`
5. Document IDs linked to manual event via `linked_document_ids`
6. Success/error feedback throughout process

#### Supported Formats:
- PDF documents
- Images (JPEG, PNG, WebP)
- Document formats (DOC, DOCX)
- All files tagged as "manual-event-attachment"

### 7. User Experience Flows

#### Create New Event:
1. User clicks "Add Important Date" from Add dropdown
2. Modal opens with empty form
3. Asset context pre-filled if coming from asset page
4. User fills required fields (title, category, due date)
5. Optional: Add repeat schedule, notes, documents
6. Submit creates event and shows success message
7. Modal closes, cache refreshed

#### Edit Existing Event:
1. Modal receives `eventId` prop for editing mode
2. Existing event data fetched and pre-filled in form
3. User can modify any fields including linked documents
4. Submit updates event via PUT request
5. Success feedback and modal close

#### Cancel/Close Behavior:
1. Dirty form check - warns user about unsaved changes
2. Clean reset of form state and uploaded files
3. Proper cleanup of temporary upload state

## API Integration

### Endpoints Used:
- `GET /api/user-assets` - Fetch assets for linking dropdown
- `GET /api/manual-events/:id` - Fetch existing event for editing
- `POST /api/manual-events` - Create new manual event
- `PUT /api/manual-events/:id` - Update existing event
- `POST /api/documents/upload` - Upload attached documents

### Request Format:
```json
{
  "title": "Home Insurance Renewal",
  "category": "Insurance Renewal", 
  "dueDate": "2025-03-15T00:00:00.000Z",
  "repeat": "annually",
  "linkedAssetId": 123,
  "linkedDocumentIds": [456, 789],
  "notes": "Contact agent 30 days before renewal"
}
```

## Error Handling

### Comprehensive Error States:
- ✅ **Network Errors**: Clear messaging for API failures
- ✅ **Validation Errors**: Field-specific error messages
- ✅ **Upload Errors**: Individual file upload failure handling  
- ✅ **Form Errors**: Prevent submission with invalid data

- ✅ **Rollback**: Proper cleanup on failure scenarios

### User Feedback:

## Performance Optimizations

### Efficient Data Loading:
- ✅ Conditional API calls (only when modal is open)
- ✅ React Query caching for assets and categories
- ✅ Optimistic UI updates where appropriate
- ✅ Debounced form validation

### File Upload Performance:

- ✅ **Document Upload**: Linked documents upload successfully and appear in UI
- ✅ **Modal Behavior**: Closes cleanly on cancel or save, surfaces errors clearly
- ✅ **Context Integration**: Pre-fills asset information when context available
- ✅ **Edit Functionality**: Allows reopening of modal for editing existing events

## Technical Implementation

### Component Architecture:
```typescript
interface ManualEventModalProps {
  isOpen: boolean;
  onClose: () => void;
  eventId?: string; // For editing existing events
  selectedAssetId?: string; // Prefill asset from context
  selectedAssetName?: string; // For display purposes
}
```
