# MyHome Application

## Overview

MyHome is a comprehensive document management application for homeowners to organize property-related documents. The project includes a complete web application (React + Node.js) and a native iOS app with advanced camera scanning capabilities. Both versions sync through a shared backend API with PostgreSQL database and simple authentication.

**Latest Update**: Consolidated navigation and editing system improvements (January 2025). Removed duplicate MyHome navigation areas and combined them into single header with integrated search functionality. Eliminated "My Documents" and "Shared with Me" sections as requested. Implemented completely inline document editing - Edit dropdown action now only enables inline editing without modal popups, while View action opens modal for viewing document details. Enhanced PDF OCR with intelligent summary generation including bill amounts extraction.

## User Preferences
