- `documents` - Document metadata and file references
- `categories` - Document organization
- `expiry_reminders` - Standalone expiry alerts

### ✅ Authentication System
Multiple authentication methods configured:
- Email/password with bcrypt hashing
- Google OAuth integration
- Session-based authentication with cookies
- Professional login/registration pages

### ✅ Production Features
All core features implemented:
- Document upload and OCR processing
- AI-powered document summarization
- Intelligent chatbot for document queries

- Responsive design for all devices

## Deployment Steps

### 1. Deploy with Replit Deployments

1. **Click the "Deploy" button** in your Replit workspace
2. **Choose "Autoscale"** for production-grade hosting with:
   - Automatic scaling based on traffic
   - Built-in load balancing
   - SSL/TLS certificates
   - Custom domain support

3. **Configure deployment settings**:
   - App name: `homedocs-production`
   - Build command: `npm run build` (already configured)
   - Start command: `npm start` (already configured)
   - Port: `5000` (automatically detected)

### 2. Domain Configuration

After deployment:
- Your app will be available at: `https://your-app-name.replit.app`
- **Custom domain**: Configure through Replit Deployments dashboard
- **SSL certificates**: Automatically provided by Replit

### 3. Google OAuth Production Setup

Update your Google OAuth settings for production:

1. **Google Cloud Console** → Your project → Credentials
2. **Edit your OAuth client**:
   - Add authorized origins: `https://your-domain.com`
   - Add redirect URIs: `https://your-domain.com/api/auth/google/callback`
3. **Update environment variables** if domain changes

### 4. Database Scaling

Your PostgreSQL database is production-ready:
- **Neon serverless**: Automatically scales with usage
- **Connection pooling**: Built into Neon for high performance
- **Backups**: Automatic daily backups included

## Production Monitoring

### Health Checks
The deployment includes:
- **Built-in health checks** at `/health` endpoint
- **Automatic restarts** if the app becomes unresponsive
- **Error logging** through Replit's dashboard

### Performance Optimization
Already configured:
- **Static file caching** for images and documents
- **Gzip compression** for API responses
- **Efficient database queries** with proper indexing
- **Image optimization** for uploaded documents

## Security Features

### ✅ Production Security
- **HTTPS enforcement** for all traffic
- **Secure session cookies** with httpOnly and secure flags
- **Password hashing** with bcrypt (12 rounds)
- **SQL injection prevention** with parameterized queries
- **File upload validation** with type and size restrictions
- **CORS protection** for API endpoints

### ✅ Data Protection
- **Session encryption** with strong secret keys
- **Secure file storage** with access controls
- **Input validation** on all API endpoints
- **Authentication middleware** protecting sensitive routes

## Post-Deployment

After successful deployment:

1. **Test all authentication methods**:
   - Create new account with email/password
   - Sign in with Google OAuth
   - Verify session persistence

2. **Test core functionality**:
   - Upload documents and verify OCR
   - Check AI summarization works
   - Test document sharing features
   - Verify expiry alerts system

3. **Monitor performance**:
   - Check response times in Replit dashboard
   - Monitor database connections
   - Verify file upload and storage

## Support and Maintenance

### Automatic Updates
- **Dependencies**: Regularly update through package.json
- **Security patches**: Monitor for critical updates
- **Database migrations**: Use `npm run db:push` for schema changes

### Scaling Considerations
Your architecture supports:
- **Horizontal scaling**: Multiple server instances
- **Database scaling**: Neon serverless auto-scaling
- **File storage scaling**: Consider CDN for high traffic
- **Session scaling**: PostgreSQL session store handles load

## Troubleshooting

Common deployment issues:
- **Environment variables**: Verify all secrets are set
- **Database connection**: Check DATABASE_URL format
- **Google OAuth**: Verify callback URLs match domain
- **File permissions**: Ensure uploads directory is writable

Your HomeDocs application is enterprise-ready with professional authentication, robust security, and scalable architecture!
