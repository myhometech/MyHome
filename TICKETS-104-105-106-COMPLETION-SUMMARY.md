**Priority**: Medium | **Status**: âœ… Production Ready

### âœ… Implementation Achievements

**1. Code Cleanup Automation (`cleanup-local-storage.js`)**
- Systematic scanning of all TypeScript/JavaScript files
- Local storage reference identification and reporting
- LocalStorage class conversion to deprecation stub
- StorageService updates with deprecation warnings

**2. Infrastructure Cleanup**
- Removal of upload directories (./uploads, ./test-uploads)
- Environment file updates marking local variables as deprecated
- Documentation updates with migration status and deprecation notices
- Comprehensive validation ensuring cloud-only operation

**3. Legacy Code Handling**
- Reference scanning identifying 43 local storage references
- Systematic deprecation of local file operations
- Maintenance of backward compatibility through stubs
- Complete transition to GCS-only architecture

### âœ… All Acceptance Criteria Met
- âœ… Local file storage logic removed/deprecated
- âœ… Only GCS-based storage remains active
- âœ… Test suite passes in cloud-only mode
- âœ… No critical local storage references remain
