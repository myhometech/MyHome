# Search As You Type Implementation Status

## Current Issue
- The storage.ts file has structural syntax errors preventing the application from starting
- Multiple duplicate method definitions and orphaned code blocks are causing TypeScript compilation failures
- Error: "Expected ';' but found 'await'" at line 692

## Implementation Plan
1. **IMMEDIATE**: Fix storage.ts syntax errors to get the app running
2. **CORE**: Implement working searchDocuments method with relevance scoring  
3. **API**: Create /api/documents/search endpoint with debouncing support
4. **FRONTEND**: Integrate SearchAsYouType component into unified-documents page
5. **TEST**: Verify real-time search across document titles, content, tags, and email metadata

## Key Features Implemented
✅ SearchAsYouType React component with:
  - Debounced input (300ms)
  - Keyboard navigation (Arrow keys, Enter, Escape)
  - Relevance scoring and match type indicators
  - Real-time dropdown suggestions
  - Content highlighting

✅ Search API endpoint at /api/documents/search

❌ Storage layer searchDocuments method (blocked by syntax errors)
❌ Frontend integration (blocked by server startup)

## Next Steps
- Fix storage.ts method structure 
- Test search functionality with real document data
- Integrate search component into main documents page

## Search Capabilities
- Document titles and filenames
- OCR extracted text content  
- Tags and categories
- Email subject/sender (for email-imported docs)
- Document summaries
- Relevance scoring (100 = exact match, 20 = content match)
