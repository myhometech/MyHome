# Email Forwarding Setup Guide

## Current Issue
The email forwarding system generates unique addresses like `docs-abc123@docs.replit.app` but cannot receive emails because:
1. No email server is configured to receive emails at this domain
2. No MX records are set up for the domain
3. No webhook or IMAP listener is configured to process incoming emails

## Solutions

### Option 1: Testing with Manual Email Simulation (Quick Setup)
For immediate testing, we can simulate email processing:

1. **Manual Email Processing**:
   - Use the existing `/api/email/test-processing` endpoint
   - Manually upload email content and attachments
   - Test the full email-to-document conversion pipeline

2. **File-based Email Simulation**:
   - Drop `.eml` email files into a watched folder
   - System processes them automatically
   - Good for testing without real email infrastructure

### Option 2: Webhook-based Email Service (Recommended)
Use a service like SendGrid Inbound Parse or Mailgun to receive emails:

1. **SendGrid Inbound Parse**:
   - Set up SendGrid account
   - Configure inbound parse webhook pointing to your app
   - Set MX record for your domain to point to SendGrid
   - Process emails via webhook at `/api/email/webhook`

2. **Required Environment Variables**:
   ```
   SENDGRID_API_KEY=your_sendgrid_api_key
   EMAIL_DOMAIN=yourdomain.com
   WEBHOOK_SECRET=random_secure_string
   ```

### Option 3: Full Email Server Setup (Production)
Set up complete email infrastructure:

1. **Domain Configuration**:
   - Purchase domain (e.g., homedocs.app)
   - Set up MX records pointing to your email server
   - Configure SPF, DKIM, and DMARC records

2. **Email Server**:
   - Set up Postfix/Dovecot or similar
   - Configure IMAP/POP3 access
   - Set up email processing pipeline

## Current Implementation Status

✅ **Working Components**:
- Unique email address generation per user
- Email content to PDF conversion
- Attachment processing and categorization
- OCR and document analysis
- Database storage of email forwards

❌ **Missing Components**:
- Email receiving infrastructure
- MX record configuration
- Webhook or IMAP processing
- Domain ownership and email service

## Immediate Steps for Testing

1. **Set up SendGrid account** (or similar email service)
2. **Configure webhook endpoint** in the app
3. **Set environment variables** for email service
4. **Test with real email forwarding**

The codebase is ready for email processing - we just need the infrastructure to receive emails.
