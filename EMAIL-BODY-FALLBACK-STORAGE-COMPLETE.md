# Email Body Fallback Storage Implementation Complete

## Summary
Enhanced the email ingestion system to store both email body content and attachments as original documents when CloudConvert conversion fails, ensuring no email content is lost.

## Problem Identified
- When CloudConvert fails, the system only stored original attachments via `processAttachmentsAsOriginalsOnly()`
- Email body content was completely lost when CloudConvert PDF conversion failed
- The email from simon@myhome-tech.com was not stored because CloudConvert failed and no fallback existed for email bodies

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Fallback Method
Updated `processAttachmentsAsOriginalsOnly()` to also handle email body storage:
- Now stores email body as plain text document when CloudConvert fails
- Preserves all email metadata and content in a readable format
- Maintains attachment fallback storage functionality

### 2. New Text Document Storage Method
Added `storeEmailBodyAsTextDocument()` method:
- Extracts plain text from HTML email body
- Creates formatted text document with email headers
- Stores in GCS with proper metadata tracking
- Uses `text_fallback` conversion engine designation

### 3. HTML to Text Conversion
Added `extractTextFromHtml()` utility:
- Removes HTML tags while preserving content
- Handles common HTML entities
- Provides clean, readable text output

## Technical Implementation

### File Changes
- **server/unifiedEmailConversionService.ts**: Enhanced fallback mechanism with email body storage

### Key Features
- **Comprehensive Fallback**: Stores both email body AND attachments when CloudConvert fails
- **Buffer-Based Storage**: Direct Buffer-to-GCS upload for text content (no filesystem dependencies)
- **Metadata Preservation**: Full email metadata stored in both document content and database
- **Audit Trail**: Proper conversion tracking with `text_fallback` engine and failure reason

### Storage Format
Text documents include:
```
EMAIL DOCUMENT (TEXT FALLBACK)
==============================

From: sender@example.com
To: recipient@myhome-tech.com
Subject: Email Subject
Date: 2025-08-13 14:00:00
Message-ID: <message-id>

CONTENT:
--------

[Plain text email content]
```

## Database Schema Support
Utilizes existing document fields:
- `conversion_engine`: `'text_fallback'`
- `conversion_reason`: `'cloudconvert_failed_fallback_to_text'`
- `upload_source`: `'email_fallback'`
- `source`: `'email'`
- `mime_type`: `'text/plain'`

## Verification Steps
1. Test email ingestion with CloudConvert failure
2. Verify both email body text document and attachment originals are stored
3. Confirm no email content is lost during conversion failures

## Impact
- **Zero Data Loss**: All email content preserved even when CloudConvert unavailable
- **User Transparency**: Clear indication of fallback storage in document names
- **System Resilience**: Email ingestion continues functioning during CloudConvert outages
- **Audit Compliance**: Complete conversion tracking and failure reasons logged
