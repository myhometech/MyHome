# Email Ingestion Deployment Verification Complete

## Status: ✅ READY FOR DEPLOYMENT

### Implementation Verified Complete
- **Route Registration**: `/api/email-ingest` properly registered in `server/routes.ts` (lines 2946-2960)
- **Route Mounting**: Routes correctly imported and mounted via `registerRoutes()` in `server/index.ts` (line 141)
- **Local Testing**: All endpoints return HTTP 200 OK locally
- **Production Build**: Successfully builds with updated routes included
- **Environment Detection**: Properly handles deployment vs development modes

### Current Endpoint Status
- **Development**: `http://localhost:5000/api/email-ingest` → "Email ingestion endpoint active - v3 DEPLOYED"
- **Local Production**: `http://localhost:5001/api/email-ingest` → HTTP 200 OK
- **Live Deployment**: `https://myhome-api.replit.app/api/email-ingest` → 404 (requires redeployment)

### Required Action
The deployment platform is running an outdated version of the code. To resolve:

1. **Go to Replit Deployments**: Navigate to the "Deployments" tool in your Replit workspace
2. **Click "Overview" tab**: Find your current autoscale deployment 
3. **Trigger Redeployment**: Click the redeploy button to force a fresh deployment
4. **Verify Update**: After deployment, test `curl -I https://myhome-api.replit.app/api/email-ingest`

### Expected Result After Redeployment
```bash
curl https://myhome-api.replit.app/api/email-ingest
# Should return: "Email ingestion endpoint active - v3 DEPLOYED"
```
