# CloudConvert Production Deployment Complete

## ✅ Production Configuration Status

### Environment Variables
- **PDF_CONVERTER_ENGINE**: `cloudconvert` (ACTIVE - overrides all flags)
- **CLOUDCONVERT_API_KEY**: Available (ending in ...DPFU)

### Engine Decision Behavior
With `PDF_CONVERTER_ENGINE=cloudconvert` set, the system now operates as follows:

1. **Environment Variable Override**: Takes highest precedence
2. **Feature Flags**: Completely bypassed by environment setting
3. **Default Fallback**: Never reached due to environment override

### Production Email Conversion Flow
| Email Component | Engine | Behavior |
|----------------|--------|----------|
| **HTML Email Body** | CloudConvert | HTML → PDF conversion |
| **Office Attachments** | CloudConvert | DOCX/XLSX/PPTX → PDF |
| **Image Attachments** | CloudConvert | JPG/PNG → PDF |
| **PDF Attachments** | None | Stored as-is (no conversion) |
| **Fallback Scenario** | Puppeteer | Only if CloudConvert API fails |

## ✅ System Verification

### Configuration Files
- `.env`: Contains `PDF_CONVERTER_ENGINE=cloudconvert`
- API Key: Properly configured with task.read/write scopes
- Engine Decision Service: Operational with proper precedence handling

### Feature Flags (Bypassed)
Both flags remain safely disabled at 0% rollout:
- `EMAIL_BODY_PDF_USE_CLOUDCONVERT`: 0% (bypassed by env)
- `EMAIL_ATTACHMENT_CONVERT_TO_PDF`: 0% (bypassed by env)

### Observability
- Engine decision reasons logged with "env:cloudconvert"
- Conversion metrics track CloudConvert usage
- Sentry integration captures CloudConvert job performance

## ✅ Production Ready

The system is now configured to use CloudConvert for ALL email conversions in production. The environment variable override ensures consistent behavior regardless of feature flag settings.

**Next Steps**: System is ready for production email processing with CloudConvert.
