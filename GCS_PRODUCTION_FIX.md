# Google Cloud Storage Production Fix

## Current Status
✅ **Production site is now working** - white screen issue resolved
✅ All core environment variables present and functional
⚠️ **GCS authentication failing** - using local storage fallback

## Root Cause
The production environment has `GCS_CREDENTIALS` set but it's trying to use Google Cloud compute engine metadata authentication (169.254.169.254) which isn't available in your deployment environment.

## Required Fix
Update your production `GCS_CREDENTIALS` environment variable to use service account JSON format:

```bash
GCS_CREDENTIALS={"type":"service_account","project_id":"your-project-id","private_key_id":"...","private_key":"-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----\n...\n-----END PRIVATE KEY-----\n","client_email":"service-account@project.iam.gserviceaccount.com","client_id":"...","auth_uri":"https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/auth","token_uri":"https://oauth2.googleapis.com/token","auth_provider_x509_cert_url":"https://www.googleapis.com/oauth2/v1/certs","client_x509_cert_url":"https://www.googleapis.com/oauth2/v1/certs/service-account%40project.iam.gserviceaccount.com"}
```

## Impact Without Fix
- Documents upload to local storage instead of Google Cloud Storage
- Limited scalability due to local storage constraints
- Missing cloud CDN benefits for document delivery

## Impact With Fix
- Unlimited document storage capacity
- Global CDN distribution for faster access
- Enterprise-grade reliability and backup

## All Other Production Variables Working ✅
- `DATABASE_URL` - Connected (213ms response time)
- `SESSION_SECRET` - Authentication working
- `OPENAI_API_KEY` - AI features operational
- `SENDGRID_API_KEY` - Email service ready
- `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` - Payment processing functional
- `SENTRY_DSN` - Error monitoring active

## Verification
After updating GCS_CREDENTIALS, check `/api/health` - the storage subsystem should show "healthy" status instead of falling back to local storage.
