I need your assistance in creating the backend required for integrating Stripe into our MyHome platform. Please scope and build the necessary backend components with the following requirements in mind:

üß© Integration Purpose:

We intend to use Stripe for processing payments related to premium subscriptions (or any other transactional functionality in the future).

üìå Backend Requirements:
	1.	Stripe Account Setup:
	‚Ä¢	Ensure that the system can securely store and access our Stripe secret keys using environment variables.
	2.	Customer Management:
	‚Ä¢	Create endpoints to:
	‚Ä¢	Create and retrieve Stripe customer objects.
	‚Ä¢	Link Stripe customer IDs to our internal user model.
	3.	Checkout and Subscriptions:
	‚Ä¢	Implement API endpoints to:
	‚Ä¢	Initiate a Stripe Checkout Session for subscription plans.
	‚Ä¢	Handle success/cancel redirects after checkout.
	‚Ä¢	Optionally support Stripe customer portal for subscription management.
	4.	Webhooks:
	‚Ä¢	Set up a secure webhook endpoint to listen for relevant Stripe events:
	‚Ä¢	checkout.session.completed
	‚Ä¢	invoice.paid
	‚Ä¢	invoice.payment_failed
	‚Ä¢	customer.subscription.updated
	‚Ä¢	customer.subscription.deleted
	‚Ä¢	Ensure event verification using Stripe‚Äôs signature secret.
	‚Ä¢	Map events to user records and update their subscription status accordingly.
	5.	Data Storage:
	‚Ä¢	Design schema additions (if needed) to track:
	‚Ä¢	Stripe customer IDs
	‚Ä¢	Subscription status
	‚Ä¢	Plan tier
	‚Ä¢	Renewal date, etc.
	6.	Security and Compliance:
	‚Ä¢	Follow Stripe‚Äôs best practices for secure integration.
	‚Ä¢	Ensure sensitive data is never logged or exposed.
	‚Ä¢	Implement access control to restrict relevant endpoints to authenticated users.
	7.	Testing and Dev Mode:
	‚Ä¢	Support both test and live keys.
	‚Ä¢	Provide mocked endpoints or sandbox setup to test locally.

‚öôÔ∏è Tech Stack Assumptions:

Please let me know if you need confirmation, but assume we‚Äôre working with:
	‚Ä¢	Node.js/Express (or adjust to our current backend stack)
	‚Ä¢	PostgreSQL (if database extensions are required)
	‚Ä¢	Stripe‚Äôs official Node SDK

Let me know if anything is unclear or if you‚Äôd like a short follow-up meeting to align. Thanks!
