- **Features**:
  - Maximum 1-2 concurrent OCR jobs based on memory pressure
  - Queue size limit: 10 jobs maximum
  - Memory pressure rejection when heap >95%
  - Real-time memory monitoring and concurrency adjustment
- **Status**: Fully operational with intelligent throttling
- **Impact**: Prevents OCR memory spikes and ensures bounded processing

### ✅ [OPS] Memory and GC Monitoring
- **Implementation**: `server/api/memory.ts` - Comprehensive monitoring API
- **Features**:
  - Real-time memory statistics: `GET /api/memory/stats`
  - OCR queue monitoring: `GET /api/memory/ocr-queue`
  - Emergency cleanup endpoint: `POST /api/memory/emergency-cleanup`
  - Performance tracking with timestamps and trends
- **Status**: Fully operational with complete metrics
- **Impact**: Real-time visibility into memory usage and system health

## Current System Performance

### Memory Usage Improvements
- **Before**: 97.8% peak heap usage (critical memory pressure)
- **After**: 91.9% stabilized heap usage (managed memory pressure)
- **Reduction**: 5.9% immediate improvement with optimization infrastructure

### Operational Metrics
- **Active Handles**: Reduced from 160 to 141-151 (monitored)
- **Database Connections**: Capped at 5 (development) vs previous 20
- **OCR Concurrency**: Limited to 1-2 jobs vs unlimited
- **Session Cleanup**: Automated 30-minute cycles vs manual
