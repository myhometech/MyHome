# MyHome Application

## Overview

MyHome is a comprehensive document management application for homeowners to organize property-related documents. The project includes a complete web application (React + Node.js) and a native iOS app with advanced camera scanning capabilities. Both versions sync through a shared backend API with PostgreSQL database and simple authentication.

**Latest Update**: Compact Upload UI Implementation (July 2025). Successfully replaced large drag-and-drop upload zones with a streamlined interface prioritizing document display. Removed central upload areas from both Insights and Document Library tabs, keeping only the header "Add Document" button for file uploads. The new unified upload component supports click-to-upload, drag-and-drop, and mobile camera/scanner functionality in a compact dialog format. This UX optimization maximizes document visibility by moving upload functionality to header-level access while preserving all upload capabilities including file picker, camera scanning, and advanced document processing.

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.
Project Direction: Building iOS version of MyHome document management app.
Essential Features: Phone camera scanning for document digitization, future Google Drive integration planned.
